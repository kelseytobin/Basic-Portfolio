                <p>
                    I am a perceptive, compassionate, and curious gal in my late 20's looking to make my mark on the
                    world. I spend a great deal of my time thinking about how I could be challenging myself and
                    contributing to the world in a larger way. I like to think of myself as awkwardly charming, with a
                    heavy inclination towards being a goober.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Living in a mountain town community and having the experiences I have had in the outdoor
                    environment here, has shaped my perspective in a way that will ultimately last. I find strength and
                    renewal in open space yet I am not immune to the limitations of living in the middle of nowhere
                    Wyoming in a tourism based economy. I hope through this class and the journey it will take me on
                    after it ends, I can find stimulation and challenge outside of my everyday.
